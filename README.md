# “ SOFT CLOTHES ”

ONLINE CLOTHING STORE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECT


# “Soft Clothes” is a web-based application designed to offer an integrated online clothing store management system. 

It helps administrators in managing various operations of a store such as customer registration, taking orders, cataloging products, and tracking payments through one integrated interface. The platform lessens the manual work of store managers by automating several key processes, thus reducing processing times and errors while improving customer experiences. 

Besides, the system provides useful business insights through customizable reports that assist in strategic decisions and operational oversight of the business. 

"Soft Clothes" is based on a strong tech stack including PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is used for both the frontend and backend, while MySQL is applied for database management.
